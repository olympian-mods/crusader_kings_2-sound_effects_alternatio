DESCRIPTION
-----------

[h1]Mod Description[/h1]
This mod replaces some sound effects with alternative or shortened versions that I personally like better than the vanilla ones.
Especially the original "Child is Born" and "Character Death" sounds have been trimmed in length.

The following sound effects will be replaced by this mod:
[list]
[*] Army Move
[*] Army Selected
[*] Character Death
[*] Character Event
[*] Child Death
[*] Child is Born
[*] Death Female Illness
[*] Death Male Illness
[*] New Alert
[*] New Priority Message
[*] Play Game
[*] Ruler Succession
[/list]

[h1]Ironman and Achievements[/h1]
Ironman: yes
Achievements: yes
